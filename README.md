# Climate Change Map

## Description

Climate Change Map (CCM) is a typescript solo project of drawing a climate change world map using React for the front-end and NestJs for the back-end. </br>
As the world's temperature has been constantly increasing these days and international authorities keep warning about the devastating impacts of the consequences, I have built a web application that shows how each country's average temperature has changed by a linear graph.

## Environment

> Front-end : Typescript 4.4.2 & React 17.0.2 </br>
> Back-end : Docker 20.10.7 & NestJs 8.0.0 (Typescript) & Flyway 0.1.9 & Python 3.9 </br>
> Database : MySql 8.0 (Docker container) </br>
> Server : AWS EC2 </br>
